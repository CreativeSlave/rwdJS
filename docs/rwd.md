Responsive Events to complement Bootstrap

It's amazing how many times I needed to invoke an event based on the
media query styles found in TW Bootstrap to accompany CSS changes to achieve
user interface goals. One might not think they need it unil they do, and then
they just find an ugly work around. BUT, this is so simple it's hard to believe
this was not included with bootstrap.

Events use the following keys: ["xs", "sm", "md", "lg", "lx"];
I hope you notice the simularity in Bootstrap's column css classNames.
The intention is to keep this VERY simple, and easy to remember.
